# ipywidgets: Interactive HTML Widgets

**ipywidgets**, also known as jupyter-widgets or simply widgets, are
[interactive HTML widgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/main/docs/source/examples/Index.ipynb)
for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel.

This package contains the python implementation of the core interactive widgets bundled in ipywidgets.

## Core Interactive Widgets

The fundamental widgets provided by this library are called core interactive
widgets. A [demonstration notebook](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/main/docs/source/examples/Index.ipynb)
provides an overview of the core interactive widgets, including:

- sliders
- progress bars
- text boxes
- toggle buttons and checkboxes
- display areas
- and more
